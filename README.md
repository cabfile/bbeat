Quite unfinished. Made primarily because StephanShi is... rather greedy. And by that I mean he really hates when people reupload his work. I mean, that's reasonable, but he did not have to literally make the source code unusable. If that's what you want to do, what's the point of putting it on GitHub in the first place???

To do: write a proper README.
